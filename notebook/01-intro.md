# Intro

C++ is a general-purpose programming language and is widely
used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative,
object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs
on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.

C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of
programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level
applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax
and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. 

Some of the features & key-points to note about the programming
language are as follows:

## Simple:
* It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.
* Machine Independent but Platform Dependent: A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.
* Mid-level language: It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)
* Rich library support: Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.
* Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.
* Pointer and direct Memory-Access: C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).
* Object-Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.
* Compiled Language: C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.
* Applications of C++: 


## C++ finds varied usage in applications such as:

* Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)
* Browsers (Chrome & Firefox)
* Graphics & Game engines (Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)
* Database Engines (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)
* Cloud/Distributed Systems
* Some interesting facts about C++: 
* Here are some awesome facts about C++ that may interest you:

The name of C++ signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C. “++”
is the C increment operator.
* C++ is one of the predominant languages for the development of all kind of technical and commercial software.
* C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.
* C++ got the OOP features from Simula67 Programming language.
* A function is a minimum requirement for a C++ program to run.(at least main() function)


# Setup a development envirment

C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays
for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and
generic programming features. 

C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc.
Before we start programming with C++. We will need an environment to
be set-up on our local computer to compile and run our C++ programs
successfully. If you do not want to set up a local environment you
can also use online IDEs for compiling your program.

Using online IDE: IDE stands for integrated development environment.
IDE is a software application that provides facilities to a computer
programmer for developing software. There are many online IDEs
available which you can use to compile and run your programs easily
without setting up a local development environment.

## Setting up local environment

For setting up your own personal development environment on your
local machine you need to install two important softwares: 

Text Editor: Text Editors are type of programs used to edit or write
texts. We will use text-editors to type our C++ programs. The normal
extension of a text file is (.txt) but a text file containing C++
program should be saved with ‘.CPP’ or ‘.C’ extension. Files ending
with the extension ‘.CPP’ and ‘.C’ are called source code files and
they are supposed to contain source code written in C++ programming
language. These extension helps the compiler to identify that the
file contains a C++ program. 

Before beginning programming with C++, one must have a text-editor
installed to write programs. 
 
C++ Compiler: Once you have installed text-editor and typed and save
your program in a file with ‘.CPP’ extension, you will need a C++
compiler to compile this file. A compiler is a computer program which
converts high-level language into machine understandable low-level
language. In other words, we can say that it converts the source code
written in a programming language into another computer language which
the computer understands. For compiling a C++ program we will need a
C++ compiler which will convert the source code written in C++ into
machine codes. Below are the details about setting up compiler on
different platforms.

**Linux Installation:** We will install the GNU GCC compiler on Linux.
To install and work with the GCC compiler on your Linux machine, proceed
according to below steps: You have to first run the below two commands
from your Linux terminal window:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install g++
```
